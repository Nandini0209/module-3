#What is File function in python? What is keywords to create and write file.

'''the file function is not used to create or manipulate files. Instead, Python uses built-in functions and
methods to handle file operations.The primary functions for file handling are open(), write(), read(), and close().

The open() function is used to open a file. This function returns a file object,
which provides methods and attributes to interact with the file.

The write() method is used to write data to a file. You need to open the file in a mode that supports writing (e.g., 'w', 'a').

 eg with open('example.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write('Hello, World!')'''
